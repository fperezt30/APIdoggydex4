Sometimes he needs to go out in the middle of the night but I think that’s just with me as when he’s stayed with friends and family they say he doesn’t do that.\nHe LOVES LOVES his fluffy toys/bear, chew toys and frisbee and will most likely get it and walk around with them and drop them in front of you if he wants you to play with him and give you puppy dog eyes.\n\nTypically he’s not a huge fan of being touched. Even if he comes and sits next to you I’d avoid touching him for the first few days as he may get startled. You watch he’ll be the biggest snuggle bunny with you two 😀\n\nThank you so so much! \nI will only be in Queensland so please feel free to text or call me whenever.\nJosie",
